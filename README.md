## Attention

This project is in its infancy, it is not recommended to be used in any environment at all at this juncture.

We are also finalizing the project and contribution guidelines.  If you come across this project and would like to help, please create an issue and let us know.

## License

We have chosen the **GNU GPL V3 License** as one of the supporting libraries we have chosen to work with is GPL V3, and we must adhere to the same license due to the built-in dependencies for GPL Projects.

We typically favour the MIT license, however the GPL V3 is still an excellent use case as the project remains open source, and that is our top priority.
